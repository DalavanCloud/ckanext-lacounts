<h2>General</h2><a href="#general"></a>
<h3>What is LA Counts?</h3><a href="#what is la counts"></a>
 LA Counts is a free and open source platform of linked and downloadable open data resources and related data stories about and for Los Angeles County. LA Counts aggregates open datasets and data stories relevant to LA County but does not host, store, or own the data on the site. Instead, LA Counts puts open data into the reach of advocates and changemakers. 
 <h3>How is LA Counts licensed?</h3><a href="#how is la counts licensed"></a>
 This site is openly licensed and proof that open data, even for a sprawling metropolis like Los Angeles County, can be a motivating factor for civic inspiration and positive social change. The data found on this site is open data but the data stories are not necessarily openly licensed. Please review each story for its respective copyrights or licensing requirements. 
 <h3>What is open data and why does it matter?</h3><a href="#what is open data and why does it matter"></a> 
 Data can be thought of as a new form of infrastructure, one that governments and businesses run on. Open data (<a href="https://opengovdata.org/">https://opengovdata.org/</a>) are datasets that individuals and organizations make publicly available for use and or redistribution without legal, technological or social restrictions. They provide the public with powerful lenses that can reveal insights about government and industry models and actions. With them data providers can be held accountable and advocates, activists, funders and policymakers can make better, more well informed decisions. LA Counts believes that data should be freely available to everyone to use and share as they wish, without restrictions from copyright, patents or other mechanisms of control.[a]
 <h3>Who built LA Counts?</h3><a href="#who built la counts"></a>
 California Community Foundation (<a href="CCF">CCF</a>) has provided the initial funding and support for LA Counts. CCF has worked for over a century to transform generosity into impact and improve the quality of life for the communities of Los Angeles County, especially the poorest and most vulnerable. Dedicated to leading social change to benefit all residents, CCF is the permanent philanthropic endowment for LA County. LA Counts is proud to have them as the originating sponsor of this work.

  <h2>Datasets</h2><a href="#datasets"></a>
 <h3>What is a dataset?</h3><a href="#what is a dataset"></a>
 A dataset is a collection of data, most commonly in the form of a table, available for access or download in one or more formats. Typically, each column of the table represents a field or variable and each row corresponds to an individual piece of data within the dataset that contains information for each field.
 <h3>What do the fields in the datasets mean?</h3><a href="#what do the fields in the datasets mean"></a>
 LA Counts encourages the publishing of data dictionaries alongside datasets to provide users with context and more details describing the fields and variables found in the dataset. If the data publisher has provided a data dictionary, it will be available under the Data and Resources section on your LA Counts dataset page.
 <h3>How do I download and use data from your site?</h3><a href="#how do i download and use data from your site"></a>
 Search LA Counts’ library (<a href="http://lacounts.org/dataset">http://lacounts.org/dataset</a>) to find a dataset of interest. Click on the title to progress to a page with more details for that dataset. Not all datasets are downloadable, but all contain links to the original data sources. Look for the Data and Resources section to find the direct download links and other site links. 
 
 
 <h3>Can I request a dataset be created or updated?</h3><a href="#can i request a dataset be created or updated"></a>
 If you would like to request additional datasets or updated revisions to existing datasets, please use the Contact Us form (<a href="http://lacounts.org/contact">http://lacounts.org/contact</a>) to suggest more datasets.
 <h3>Why are the datasets in different formats?</h3><a href="#why are the datasets in different formats"></a>
 LA Counts is proud to provide the ability to see many different LA County-centric datasets gathered into one central location: this accomplishment has never been achieved before. Datasets come in different file formats according to the type of data being stored and the sharing choices made by the data publisher. Regardless of the file type, LA Counts encourages datasets to be provided in digital, machine-readable formats. For further explanation of common file types, please visit the Open Data Handbook (<a href="http://opendatahandbook.org/guide/en/appendices/file-formats/">http://opendatahandbook.org/guide/en/appendices/file-formats/</a>). 
 <h3>Why are some datasets so messy?</h3><a href="#why are some datasets so messy"></a>
 LA Counts datasets are presented without alteration or intervention. We believe that data quality is important but LA Counts does not own or host any of the datasets. Because our datasets are harvested from various publishers with unique requirements and needs, some datasets may need to be cleaned. 
 <h3>Why is some metadata missing or incomplete?</h3><a href="#why is some metadata missing or incomplete"></a>
 Unfortunately, it is not a requirement for publishers to fill out every applicable metadata field. This leads to missing information in the metadata section. Dataset quality and usefulness depends on accurate metadata that describes the dataset. LA Counts has created a technique to measure completeness: the Metadata Completion Rate (<a href="explained below). If you have a concern about this, please let us know here (http://lacounts.org/contact">explained below). If you have a concern about this, please let us know here (http://lacounts.org/contact</a>).
 <h3>What’s the metadata completion rate?</h3><a href="#what’s the metadata completion rate"></a>
 The green or red circle on dataset pages indicates completeness against 12 required metadata fields. This tool aims to help both data publishers and data practitioners to recognize opportunities for improvement as well as discuss and address dataset hygiene. Please see our blog post (<a href="NEED LINK">NEED LINK</a>)[b] describing the metadata completion rate in greater detail.
 <h3>How do I clean a dataset?</h3><a href="#how do i clean a dataset"></a>
 To learn more about the data cleaning process and for a quick 6-step guide, you can read more here (<a href="https://www.geotab.com/blog/data-cleaning/">https://www.geotab.com/blog/data-cleaning/</a>).
 <h3>Where can I learn more about getting started with data?</h3><a href="#where can i learn more about getting started with data"></a>
 You can learn more about getting started with data by visiting WPRDC (<a href="http://www.wprdc.org/beginners/">http://www.wprdc.org/beginners/</a>).
 
 
 
  <h2>Data Stories</h2><a href="#data stories"></a>
 <h3>What is a data story?</h3><a href="#what is a data story"></a>
 Data stories help to illuminate the power of open data. By analyzing datasets, storytellers may uncover insights and reveal stories that may be hidden in the data. LA Counts features 5 types of data-focused stories: 
 * data stories
 * data visualizations
 * profiles & interviews
 * Methodologies
 * white papers & research
 <h3>How do I get started writing a data story for LA Counts?</h3><a href="#how do i get started writing a data story for la counts"></a>
 In order to write a data story, all you need is a dataset of interest to you! There are many ways to write a data story: these may include analyzing a dataset(<a href="s), creating a visualization, and/or writing down your data journey. If you still don’t know where to begin, the LA Counts blog has a few profile interviews (http://lacounts.org/dataset?story_type=Blog+post">s), creating a visualization, and/or writing down your data journey. If you still don’t know where to begin, the LA Counts blog has a few profile interviews (http://lacounts.org/dataset?story_type=Blog+post</a>) that may help with inspiration.

 <h3>What are the LA Counts Community Topics?</h3><a href="#what are the la counts community topics"></a>
 Community topics are areas that LA Counts chooses to focus on, in order to highlight areas that have been traditionally overlooked, underreported or underfunded. By tagging a dataset or data story with a topic label, this is our way of letting you know which topic the dataset / data story falls under.
